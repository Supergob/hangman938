# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

I have so far implemneted the basic logic of asking the user for input and matching that against a randomised but predetermined list of words.
