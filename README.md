# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it within a certain number of attempts. This implementation of Hangman is designed for single-player use, where the computer selects a random word from a predetermined list and the player tries to guess it.

## Features

- Random selection of a word from a predefined list.
- Ability for the player to guess letters and check if they are in the word.
- Display of the guessed letters and the remaining lives.
- Game termination upon either running out of lives or correctly guessing the word.

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the program.
2. When prompted for input, enter a letter.
3. Continue guessing letters until you either run out of lives or correctly guess the word.
4. Check the live tracker to see what letters you've guessed and how many are left.
5. The game terminates when one of these conditions is met.

## File Structure

- The project consists of a single Python file.
- The file contains a class named `Hangman`, which encapsulates the game logic and functionality through various methods.
