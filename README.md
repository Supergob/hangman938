# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

I have so far implemneted the basic logic of asking the user for input and matching that against a randomised but predetermined list of words. 

added ability to check the guess provided by the user aswell as the ability to ask for said guess.
added ability to terminate game when set number of lives runs out.

Usage instructions:

Run program.
When prompted for input, enter a letter.
Continue to follow prompts until you either run out of lives or win the game.
Game terminates when one of said conditions is met.

File structure:

Consists of one python file.
File consists of one class named Hangman which contains multiple methods to provide functionality.
